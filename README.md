# College Canteen Food Ordering Web App

This project is a modern Python Flask web application designed exclusively for ordering food from the college canteen. With over 20,000 students on campus, the canteen often experiences long queues and crowded waiting areas during lunch and snack times. This app was developed to solve that problem by allowing students to order food in advance and collect it quickly by showing their order ID—eliminating the need to stand in line.

## Features
- Browse canteen menu and order food online
- Add items to a cart and place orders
- Receive a unique order ID for collection
- Skip the queue—just show your order ID to collect your food

## Getting Started
1. Install Python 3.x
2. Install Flask: `pip install flask`
3. Run the app: `python app.py`

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: Main Flask application
- `templates/`: HTML templates
- `static/`: Static files (CSS, JS)

## Why This App?
Waiting in long lines wastes valuable time for students and canteen staff. By ordering ahead, students can enjoy their meals without the hassle, and the canteen can serve more people efficiently.
